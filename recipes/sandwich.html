    <h2>Description </h2>
    <p>
        The grilled cheese sandwich is the ultimate comfort food. It's golden and 
        crispy on the outside, with a warm, gooey cheese filling on the inside. 
        This simple sandwich is popular worldwide and can be made in minutes using 
        just bread, cheese, and butter. While it sounds basic, the secret to a 
        great grilled cheese lies in using good-quality bread and cheese, along 
        with proper toasting. You can enjoy it on its own as a quick snack, pair it 
        with soup for a hearty meal, or customize it with add-ins like tomatoes, 
        onions, or even bacon for extra flavor.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 slices of sandwich bread (white, brown, or sourdough)</li>
        <li>2 slices of cheddar cheese (or mozzarella, American, or any melting cheese)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter (softened, for spreading)</li>
        <li>A pinch of black pepper (optional)</li>
        <li>Tomato slices (optional, for variation)</li>
    </ul>

        <li>Place one slice of bread, butter side down, on the hot pan.</li>
        <li>Add the cheese slices on top of the bread. If using extras like tomato slices, add them now.</li>
        <li>Place the second slice of bread on top, butter side up.</li>
        <li>Cook until the bottom slice is golden brown and crispy, about 2-3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Carefully flip the sandwich with a spatula and cook the other side until golden and the cheese has melted.</li>
