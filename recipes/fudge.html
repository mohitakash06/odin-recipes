    <h2>Description </h2>
    <p>
        Chocolate fudge is a rich, smooth, and indulgent dessert made with 
        chocolate, condensed milk, and butter. It has a creamy texture that melts 
        in your mouth and a deep chocolate flavor that satisfies any sweet craving. 
        Fudge is a popular treat during holidays, parties, or as a quick homemade 
        sweet. The best part about this recipe is that it requires only a handful 
        of ingredients and very little time to prepare. With just a saucepan and a 
        few minutes of stirring, you'll have a delicious batch of fudge that looks 
        impressive but is incredibly easy to make.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups semi-sweet chocolate chips (or chopped chocolate)</li>
        <li>1 can (14 oz) sweetened condensed milk</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>

        <li>Let it cool at room temperature for a few minutes, then refrigerate for at least 2 hours.</li>
