    <h2>Description </h2>
    <p>
        French fries are one of the most popular snacks and side dishes in the 
        world. They are crispy on the outside, soft and fluffy on the inside, and 
        absolutely addictive. Originally popularized in Europe, fries are now a 
        staple in fast food and homemade cooking alike. Making perfect French fries 
        at home requires a simple double-frying technique: the first fry cooks the 
        potatoes through, and the second fry makes them crispy and golden. When 
        seasoned with salt and served hot, they make the perfect side for burgers, 
        sandwiches, or just as a snack with ketchup or mayonnaise.
